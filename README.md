## Usage Guide

- Tokens defined in the figma file matches variables declared in CSS
- All classes associated with the design system are prefixed with a global namespace followed by a hyphen: `nu-`
- In addition to a global namespace, we added prefixes to each class to make it more apparent what job that class is doing using BEM syntax
  * `c-` for UI components, such as `.nu-c-h1` or `.nu-c-card`
  * `l-` for layout-related styles, such as `.nu-l-grid__item` or `.nu-l--two-column`
  * `u-` for utilities, such as `.nu-u-mb-<spacing-token>` or `.nu-u-margin-bottom-pt2`
  * `is-` and has- for specific states, such as `.nu-is-active` or `.nu-is-disabled`. These state-based classes - would apply to
  * `js-` for targeting JavaScript-specific functionality, such as `.js-modal-trigger`. No styles are bound to these classes; they’re reserved for behavior only. For most cases, these `js-` classes would toggle - state-based classes to an element.
